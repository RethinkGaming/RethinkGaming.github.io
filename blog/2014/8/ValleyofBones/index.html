  <h1>Facing Your Bones <span class="stars"></span></h1>

    <h1 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h1>

<p>It seems work on the website is going slowly. Over the past few days, I’ve been too worried about returning back to school that all else seems to have been cut out of my life. It’s good to be back, however, where I can channel my pent up energy into productivity. I hope this motivation will last indefinitely.</p>

<h1 id="whats-in-the-closet">What’s in the Closet?</h1>

<p>When thinking about a closet, homosexuality mainly comes to mind. However, the closet is not a place to hide away one’s sexual preferences. The boy believed that, in general, the closet is just some imaginary lockbox to hide away the things that cause us shame.</p>

<p>The Boy used to be religious. He went to church and read scripture. He even attended a summer church retreat. The Boy didn’t regret his previous religious identity. It provided him support and provided an outlet of faith when he found no reason to place it in himself.</p>

<p>Of note, one summer camp had a message on one of the older passages of the Bible. The book and specific verse escaped the Boy’s memory, but the morals still rang true. The Valley of Bones was an allegory that most glazed over. It was simple, and as dry as its inhabitants. Yet, it was this passage that stuck with me all these years. To the Boy, the passage represented the cess pit of sins were against his moral compass. Things he was guilty of, shameful of, or embarrassed of, all sank deep into the sand and decayed until all that remained were the dry frames of humanity.</p>

<p>The Boy found himself in the Valley again. He came face to face with restless spirits that tempted him to retain his bad habits. Habits that lead him to fail in his studies as well as his relationships. Such voices had been clawing their way above the sand. Some were old enough to have begun the process of fossilization.</p>

<p>Bones rarely go away, of this the Boy understood. But monsters in a sand valley are not ones the boy needed to be afraid of showing. Few people from the uplands were even aware such a Valley existed. They wouldn’t even know where to look for my Bones. And, if on one coincidental day, a stranger comes across this Valley of his, the Boy could serve as a guide and present his bones as a collection of defeated demons, not daunting wardens.</p>

<p>And who knows, perhaps one day, the Boy may leave his Valley, and its inhabitants, behind. He can sure hope.</p>
